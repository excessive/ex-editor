# DOMy Preliminary Specification Sheet

**All objects have the following specification:**

* The first value in sequential pairs must always be the object type
* The second value in sequential pairs will be the object value given an object is expected to have an explicit value (such as a text box) and that the value is not a function or a table that contains an object type declaration. This allows for formatted text to be written in a table so long as the first value of that table is not "textbox", "button", et cetera
* All sequential pairs thereafter will be assumed to be child objects and any pair that is not formatted correctly will be discarded

## Input Events

***Virtual Input Eventsâ„¢ is a processing layer for events that can take in raw input from love or from any other source (e.g. network). VIE can be toggled in part or in full to allow full customization of if and when the GUI should be accepting input, and from where (e.g. only enable mouse events if some flag is set).***

**Bubble:** Event propagates up through document hierarchy from the target object to the root ancestor.

**Capture:** Event propagates down through document hierarchy from the root ancestor to the target object.

**Catch:** Object takes over event and stops propagation from going further.
